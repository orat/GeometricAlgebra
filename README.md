# GeometricAlgebra
Geometric algebra package reference implementation.

This is a refactored version of the implementation developped by Daniel Fontijne and published as a reference for the [book](https://geometricalgebra.org) "Geometric algebra for Computer Science", Leo Dorst, Daniel Fontijne and Stephen Mann, 2005.

The refactoring includes mainly additions in the javadoc, reformatting, eliminating of not needed methods, renamings etc. It also resolves the dependency to the [https://dst.lbl.gov/ACSSoftware/colt/install.html](colt library).
